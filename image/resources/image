-> vulnerability URL: http://10.12.100.119/?page=media&src=nsa

after inspecting we realize the page displays the image using the object tag, knowing the object tag can carry data payload, we can then convert a js to base64, and pass it to the object tag through the url, therefor initiating a
js injection, which is known as XSS attack
